bc they're up all the time and then you don't have to fuck with setup
recommend looking @ wargames instead
high school crypto can be done locally
however i think they might release images and instructions on how to run those
and those are currently up but will be taken down soon
some of them require a remote server
but that was the week where i had double counting from using two separate computers simultaneously
apparently i had a 99h week
i hit 73 back in march
that may be a personal record?
(on the computer)
oops
high school crypto
2. it's just hash cracking
1. 3ppl have solved it
um you probably don't wanna do that one
which
also dl putty
tell me why u want an account
hold on before i give you an acct
what do you want to do
or u could dl virtualbox and an ubuntu 64b desktop iso and use that
and you can dl files directly to it
i'll just give u an account on my server
here wait

CINDA TOO PREFERS USING THE BIG STAIRCASE
JUST FOR THE TECORD
i'd recommend logging into the main instance on mastodon.social and squatting your favorite username
here's a list of instances, if you wanna check it out i recommend picking not the primary one
(this is like, one of the core tenets of hacker ethos and also one of the core criticisms of hacker ethos)
bc then it's not like a single company has full control over it
decentralized is good
responsible social network design is something that i've recently gotten into
blowing up on twitter rn
drawback: once you make an account, i think you're tied to that instance
ie, connect to other instances
you can run your own instance and then "federate"
looks exactly like twitter
decentralized social network
i don't remember if i posted this or not: i don't think so
please do not
that is
yes
kinda but also tired
palmer luckey left facebook

Sorry to continue this, but one last item.
^that gave me the impression that there are a lot of jewish ppl in the uni's upper ranks

y'all should cmover for alcohol tn
if that clears up
well
lol what the fuck
this include denying other citizens the right to make certain kinds of speech they disagree with in forums they control
***first
also, other private citizens are allowed to do precisely whatever the fuck they want
the school isn't subject to that, since it's not directly the govt
eg shouting fire in a movie theater
Neil the second amendment means "the govt is not allowed to prosecute you for what you say unless what you say implies you're gonna hurt others or cause disruptions"
naturally their logo is a shitty photoshop  on the old chief logo

@hellahawkward can i re-add you to polls and planning
ssh netid@address
sudo su testuser
sudo adduser testuser
sure you could try
idk i guess it could be your internet
probably a local setting
@hellahawkward i doubt you're flagged on the firewall
then try connecting
mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.old
mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old
if that doesn't work
then try connecting
sudo mv /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/ssh/ssh_config.old
could be bad ssh key
try remlnx.ews.illinois.edu
i feel like there should've been more
is this all that came out from ssh -v?
local firewall possibly blocking outbound connections?
paste the output of ssh -v
-v means verbose
try ssh -v netid@address
do you always enter your password, or no?
how do you normally connect to ews?
define lock your laptop
Nice

you ssh in and run a GUI application?
wait, via command line? or something like fastx?
thank you
huh, looks handy
open source matlab?
you mean remote desktop?
ssh is command line connection
citrix?
@bergels and @hellahawkward: what options do i have for running matlab on my computer?
yeah i think that might be the case

i'm very proud of it
i made a new resume

O ≠ theta

i mean, google it
i believe there is a location in 2 based on a particular city wall in krakow
i'm p sure everything's made up but it's set basically in medieval poland
it's based on slavic folklore
email fleck and ask her to change it if it bugs you
and you've never made a mistake?
sorta
i'd be happy to hop in and help
lmk if you need a summon!
if you can get an allied summon that's help you a lot but idk if that's possibly for him
or making him jump off a very high drop
i think i cheated by repeatedly drop attacking on him
yeah he's a load of shit
havel!
ppl explaining things shittily
it's a problem in computers
don't worry about it when someone drops random acronyms
they're writing english words using the greek letters that look most like the english words.
tldr copy some OS files to your computer, mod em, copy em back
no.
butt is love, butt is life
if there's one thing in life that I do not need, it is more cardio
whoops, should've checked the schedule
ran to arc, closed
ran to crce, closed
i can filter it but i don't really care

apparently google analytics spam is now a thing
i heard about this like last week from another blogger
nah this is in my google analytics page
dumping that string into the "language" field
lmao, i checked my blog's analytics page for the first time in a while and some russia kid's been doing something funny w google search results

i don't like paying for web hosting bc ppl literally give it away for free
you can also use github to host shit if it's just static html
aws gives you a public ip
heroku gives you a subdomain.heroku.com
heroku free, aws free are both options
Neil we have personal host space?
wait
not "ford the manufacturer"
this appears to be a particular ford dealer

s'no reason i can't like both things about it
i'm also interested in gay chars in shows
i love the hopeful spacefaring message and feel of star trek
apparently the reasoning was bc they changed it from the show, where the creator (gene roddenberry) has decided against implying sulu was gay
....
like they make a point of showing him hugging his kid and then his husband
is gay
the young guy who plays mr sulu/george takei
in star trek beyond, which is placed before the events of the episodic series
ooh
@ half price books so i figure it might be cheaper than usual

merry christmas, all.
i bring it upon myself by not sucking it up and going. ah well. life goes on.
i am confident the parents will be upset with me for the rest of the day, though
after years of it being a bitter point, my mother didn't force me to church today
your clock is slightly behind

you should convince your parents to go somewhere else
yo
empty threats of the latter also happened yesterday
the former happened yesterday

I'M GETTING A FUCKING A IN THAT THANK YOU V MUCH

next semester i will have a 4 point oh for sure

i'm salty had i been half a letter grade higher my gpa would be exactly where i want it to be
(final grades are out)
oh man i always get super pessimistic the week between finals and final pgrades

@bergels which witcher to start with?
gonna apply to cd project red
okay maybe i'm
SURE ENOUGH
also, they own GOG???
apparently polish PMs literally gave a copy to obama
moms know about it as "one of the best rpgs ever"
it's fucking huge
poland drowns cd projekt red in cash
in other news
it's "neural net prediction" so maybe they're using a neural net for processor pipelining
enter once
ctrl f neural
idk why that applies to processor design
afaik!
and then it'll start producing results that you want
and you pump data in to "train" it
it's basically a big finite state machine i think? or graph with a fuckton of nodes
that's kinda weird to me, neural network is something i usually hear in CS circles
rest up

anything bigger i'd pull from the savings acct
ideally i'd just have a debit card with like, $500 in a checknig account
that's a bit more thinking than i like to deal with tho
basically
savings accounts they just assume money's not gonna move as much
it deals with how banks handle money
frequent withdrawals is what they're annoying about
frequent deposits is never bad
i don't think so
so the second i lose my wallet i cann anyway
no there's a $500 withdrawal cap on my debit card
uh fucking i always forget which

um
heh
perhaps i'm tired and salty because this has been a long week, and that's all.
i'm criticizing your use of generalizations.
ie, criticize what oliver's showstaff did than what is done in "many situations"
it's better to be critical of specific actions than a generalized "it's done in many situations"
if yer gonna be critical of something
the final part was just making it relatable, giving you a diverse cast of ppl too
had the factual basis and the substantive content
the rest of the video
literally
i'm slightly peeved b/c i'm sick of that meme
i messaged her asking about it first
she messaged me about it yesterday
probably the same thing
just messagin zoe n saw the message from her from last night
i honestly cannot remember
did i mention it yesterday?
ie: a jury can say "fuck the law, this person is violating it but we don't believe they should be convicted"
so jury nullification is a thing
mhm

trans sex is not something i am well versed in, so i can't really give you good advice there
not a bad call. be prepared for assholery tho.

"Ah gotcha but you live in Lincoln Wood though right that's an hr away right? Dam well one of these days you should come out for a weekend to r1 it's 5min from my house if you needed a place to crash you can at my place if needed."
him: "Well to be honest in my eyes you are quite attractive if you don't mind me saying."
later down the line
works for me
he plays itg
he likes pot
okay, he's gay
him: "Lol hell no I ain't a dick to anyone while being high unless you call me a fag or queer to my face then we have a problem."
me: "s'not my thing, but i don't hate on it
s'long as your not being a dick to others when you're high"
o k
"i'm like one of the very few people that enjoying getting high and play dance games it relaxes me and just makes it more fun I guess idk you probably be against it I would assume"
"The manager at round 1 Jeff is awesome he's the hosting it. Hey gave me to heads up that I can leave and come back mainly just to smoke some bud and come back in haha. Bud+Dance games = Awesomeness😄"
first big red flag:
he's talking about a lock-in at an arcade
he's like, 24 to my 19, so +5 years
he's being jovial
he's really good - like, windeu/rynker good. top tier, has world records.
this itg doubles player adds me on fb. we have mutuals so i'm like "sure"
okay story time
I was getting hit on by a guy five years older than me a couple days ago
oh coincidentally I have a story I will share soon
if you're not, ask "are you flirting with me?" if answer is yes "please stop"
if you're interested, flirt back and see if you guys rib off each other
but rather they're just friendly
remember that some people may simply interact in that way, i.e., they are not flirting
some ppl have a harder time picking it up
it takes practice
me @ my coworkers
it's all down from here

 "We know about as much about software quality problems as they knew about the Black Plague in the 1600s. We've seen the victims' agonies and helped burn the corpses. We don't know what causes it; we don't really know if there is only one disease. We just suffer -- and keep pouring our sewage into our water supply." ~ Tom Van Vleck

i asked him to stop
I think that's p common

it's week 6
excellent storytelling.
amazing worldbuilding.
this is amazing.
they're literally deleting shit he contradicts on tv

somehow autopiloted to nato
meant eu
oops
EEC, european economic community, got absorbed into nato anyway
no, EEC was formed in 1958
point is to facilitate conversations between nato and member govt parliaments
subset of nato formed in 1955
one of the originals
i've been to one nato building
yeah
eu's building is in brussels, nato's is as well i think?
undermining global stability
fuck putin
i have been to the EU
the point of the eu is to encourage international cooperation and trade within european member states Thank You Very Much
whoops
no
is it eu
ooh google russia would be cool
i gotta apply to more places
i can work anywhere in the eu
oh man
that'd be booooooooooooomb
yoooooooooooooooooo
but if they hire both of us
if u get the pos and i don't i'mma be Salty tho
yo you should
hahaha
goopole
i should apply to polish google
o shit
i also just asked my cousin to ask my uncle if he knows anyone there or @ polish google
i'm glad that i can put polish down tho
english is working language
not true
^i applied
ooh time for some porn
but rather suits for the sake of fun, or looking amazing
part of my pull to CS was the fact that i need work environments that aren't suits only for suits sake
my spaces need to be colorful
i can't cubicle work, i'll die
and you're just about done with it after 241, no?
core CS here is Good
i mean as well as is a pretty subjective measurement
90-something% employment rates for kids coming outta cs
and it's a safe decision
it's a hopping professional scene
it's a hopping social scene
we could afford it
but we came to college anyway b/c
we're smart and motivated
that being said like, we could all do CS on our own
esp if they can't afford
i'm saying they probably shouldn't be in expensive collegese
i'm not saying they're shit people
is it worth going into such intense debt?
what's your roi?
150k for a communications undergrad tho? an english undergrad? a creative writing eundergrad?
give us, basically automatically, cushy engineering jobs
our max 150k investments
we're making good economic decisions
see here's the thing
b/c ppl view it as an essential good
it's supply/demand are fucked
it's not.
one of the big problems is college is viewed as a necessity
yes, yes this
even though it disproportionately kills poc as a result
"the military is a good thing for poc b/c it gives them a way to pay for college"
to the argument
this is tantamount
b/c blue is my fave color
blue icons are best icons
and that makes me dislike being school-sprit-y
i don't like how sports are embedded into academic institutions
lol fuck school spirit
sketchy
no
that's a lot of time for $50
how much time?

/@prosa100 's
that's about the last time I've updated it
It has my most recent job on there
yes, not really
does anybody have a trenchcoat
probably something along the lines of "women and men doing the same job deserve the same pay, "do a good job" is a poor measurement that allows for systemic sexism to persist in wage distribution"
i mean give the opportunity she'd almost certainly nuance that quote from him
it seems like she's trying to crtitcize him and she pulled a bad quote for that purpose
looking back at it now
when she first said that line i was like "uh"
i remember her saying that and feeling like "um, i don't totally agree with that statement"
it'd be helpful if you pulled up a time linked YouTube video to that part of the debate

so
AUSTIN IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET THAT
it's blue
just bought one
with itg patches sewn on
hmmm i want a blue headband
hmmm you can't really do that with a hairtie
problem is that i get headaches from having hair up for too long
yes
a spare headband
does anybody have
heading home
heading to DDR
you're not allowed to like that thing
out with you
no
python ❤️
anna is very excited b/c it's themed around barley production
there i sa hackathon this weekend sponsored by anheuser buschc
ask my boss
let me
idk if they want tech or what the deal is
what's important is that you sell it
whatever you build, it needs to be sellable
also eat food
I will happily give the presentation to my bosses boss tho
look I'm planning on doing csaw quals that weekend
their office is super fucking pretty
literally just applied to opera b/c
SO GOOD
you can
but in order to win you need to sell the data analytics aspect
you tap a photo of a tap and that enabled beer to flow
made an android application
probably not good for the purpose of winning the hackathon
yes, ana
post inv link here and tag ppl you think would be intersted
yo neil go for it
we have an apartment chat
that is to say i don't like it very much
the interview room waiting area is not a good environmetn
11ya
how much for? does this put you over 100% of tuition costs now?
#cashmoney
@ vagina-havers
that's literal assault
oh this anime is notoriously bad
audiosurf 2 runs on osx
maybe
so we can totally win and collect xbox ones / amazon echoes / sphere bb8's / apple tvs for 8 people
confirmed that hackathon has 8 person team cap
pmege is looking for more echoes so he can tear the apart and hack the hardware
that could be fun
hmmmmmmmmmmm
potentially sell em for cash
then we can all collect the prizes
another echo, right?
what's the prize for that?
we can all come in and say we're "on the team" (cap is 8 i believe)
and
w/ neil probably
i can do the presentation (i know one of the judges he's my boss's boss)
2-4 ppl can do all the work
no matter what, the way they do tha hackathon
or you could make $500
they do big data for farmers
maybe
land a job with agrible????
if you do something really really cool you could probably
we can try refining that idea
if you flesh that out with me some
Anna what you were talking about earlier about doing some hops stuff
for this specifically they're really, really interested in like an "analytics platform" so if you bullshit that hard and sell it
hackathons are literally just build the prettiest frontend you can and sell it
i have a pretty good idea of what you need to appeal to in order to win it tho
this hackathon is v nice b/c hardware
do both
hmmmm maybe i'll just
to do csaw
i want
ohhhhh wait

father forwarded me an email
UNDERSTANDING ENGINEERS

  The linear, logical mind...

Understanding Engineers #1
Two engineering students were
biking across a university campus when one said, "Where
did you get such a great bike?" The second engineer
replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday, minding
my own business, when a beautiful woman rode up on this
bike, threw it to the ground, took off all her clothes and
said, "Take what you want." The first engineer
nodded approvingly and said, "Good choice: The clothes
probably wouldn't have fit you anyway."

Understanding Engineers #2

  To the optimist, the glass is
half-full. To the pessimist, the glass is half-empty. To the
engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.

Understanding Engineers #3

 A priest, a doctor, and an engineer
were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of
golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with those
guys? We must have been waiting for fifteen minutes!"
The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've
never seen such inept golf!" The priest said,
"Here comes the greens-keeper. Let's have a word
with him." He said, "Hello George, What's
wrong with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow,
aren't they?" The greens-keeper replied, "Oh,
yes. That's a group of blind firemen. They lost their
sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we
always let them play for free anytime!." The group fell
silent for a moment. The priest said, "That's so
sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them
tonight." The doctor said, "Good idea. I'm
going to contact my ophthalmologist colleague and see if
there's anything she can do for them." The engineer
said, "Why can't they play at night?"

Understanding Engineers #4

  What is the difference between
mechanical engineers and civil engineers? Mechanical
engineers build weapons. Civil engineers build
targets.

Understanding Engineers #5

  The graduate with a science degree
asks, "Why does it work?" The graduate with an
engineering degree asks, "How does it work?" The
graduate with an accounting degree asks, "How much will
it cost?" The graduate with a business degree asks, "Do you
want fries with that?"

Understanding Engineers #6

  Three engineering students were
gathered together discussing who must have designed the
human body. One said, "It was a mechanical engineer.
Just look at all the joints." Another said, "No,
it was an electrical engineer. The nervous system has many
thousands of electrical connections." The last one
said, "No, actually it had to have been a civil
engineer. Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through
a recreational area?"

Understanding Engineers #7

  Normal people believe that if it
ain't broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if
it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features
yet.

Understanding Engineers #8

  An engineer was crossing a road one
day, when a frog called out to him and said, "If you
kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess." He
bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket. The
frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me, I'll
turn back into a beautiful princess and stay with you for
one week." The engineer took the frog out of his
pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog
then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a
princess, I'll stay with you for one week and do
anything you want." Again, the engineer took the frog
out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. Finally,
the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you
I'm a beautiful princess and that I'll stay with you
for one week and do anything you want. Why won't you
kiss me?" The engineer said, "Look, I'm an
engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a
talking frog - now that's cool."
spoken like a true californian
i hope the message made em giggle
awwww they disappeared

"In Japan, the classification comprises people aged between 15 and 34 who are not employed, not engaged in housework, not enrolled in school or work-related training, and not seeking work."
"A NEET or neet is a young person who is "Not in Education, Employment, or Training". The acronym NEET was first used in the United Kingdom but its use has spread to other countries including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan."
@Bratzworth what's a NEET?
you would be best off texting her or fbming

corroborating Nate: "So, for instance, when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year, the police have to record each of these events, which might be more than 300 events. In many other countries it would just be one record - one victim, one type of crime, one record."

probs not tn eaither
only on ptr, the beta server
no
she's pharah's mom
well its official
yet, probably
to level it up
upon capture it starts at three
yeah but like
if enemy, it goes down
if friendly trainers attack it, the xp bar for the gym goes up
there's an xp bar
the level corresponds to the number of ppl you can have in it
i think it starts at three
so they have a level
you can get 4 candy/pokemon
@ paul it's faster than that
before i hit the shield
i held one briefly up by chicago but got booted
this is why i brought it up
anyway
it became really prominent in cs go
which translates to bitch whore
there's a russian word pronouced suka blyat
so there's a meme
but it's developed so much memetic meta cause of translations to english
really pronounced suka blyat
wait it's actually
that i just saw it written in cyrillic as suka blyat
has gotten so strong
the csgo suka blyat meta

"The point of Pokémon Go is to travel around, exploring different geographic areas to find appropriate Pokémon. In a small town, expect to find a lot of normal- and grass-types. Going near water will attract water Pokémon. Playing at night brings out more nocturnal creatures, like Clefairy and Gastly."

I love how much softer the click is tho
I don't like where the extra buttons are
cause
remap it to melee
i might
there's a sniper button that changed the sensitivity but I dunno how it works yet
cause then you don't have to adjust every time you get to a new system
well like its almost better to leave things as default
with adjusting settings
but i'd rather just get used to it so that when i plug into new systems i don't have to deal
logitech software
i need to install like
this one does
is annoying

compatibility issues are a concern
wait
Anna basically see if nate can pick it up for you
that's an incredibly good price they're normally around $135
that's a v good price too
also soumithri has a gaming 7
i bought one for kris's computer and it's been reliable
imo msi gaming 5 is a good board
anna, do you have a pcpartpicker setup?
for anna's parts?
still a 35m ride
a highway ride away
Nate is most direct
hold on i'll check my map to see who's closest
check if there's a fry's near you
it's an in-store deal
no
this is about $30 off
I'm thinking for Anna
$90 pretax MSI gaming 5 motherboard

IT'S SO GOOD THO
arguably the best scene scene from any game from last year
also
it's very well written
mary you'd get a kick out of tales from the borderlands

i have the wolf among us
i can supply my games library
mary if u want
^bring me to life but better
i feel like it's a part of my polish duty

give it a shot
hmmmm maybe i'll
but also i don't know much
like boring gritty
wolfenstein new order looked a bit too gritty for me?
been tempted to do metro
i've
give deus ex another shot
maybe i should
hmmmm
i really like story based shooters
i think you mentioned that a while ago
oooooh
that could be rightfully fucking terrifyng if done well
i've never played a cyberpunk shooter
kickstarter reward
and by pretty i mean fucking gorgeous
if you pay 5k you can get a prettily-styled razer latpopt
unless it's on the cusp of making it
and then i'll pick it up
i'll wait to hear if it's good
i'm thinking
they're a company that rebuilds old games
i think
i'm not sure?
do i back it or not
hmmmmm
it's a unity fps build
i wonder if that's why shodan.io is shodan.io
n
system shock's villain is named shoda
system shock is getting a reboot
holy fucking shit
overheated and shutdown right?
don't

is this???
It was ten yours ago when THE LEMONPEOPLE invaded, juicing all in their path.

Attempting to free the Earth from their tyranny, you have endured pulpy and sour battles.

This has now culminated in you reaching the throne room of THE LEMONLORD.

Armed with your right-facing curly brace, you charge into battle.

reaper is satisfying to play well
i get pretty bad lockjaw after playing too long tho
and just have fun
i need to remember to not get too invested into stats
and also
the best metric is probably score/min?
you can just switch on/off ppl when you're losing
i think winrate is partly game-able b/c
zarya is so good
a 75% lucio winrate
wow u have
yeah it's really easy to stomp w friends esp if you team comp correctly and work together
52%? damn son
jacqui ur winrate is so good
3k globally for total score as winston
jacqui you're ranked
they melt winston so badly
dam boy
so bias
a 75% winrate
i like winston the best tho but also i have
free ult charge for enemy team
on the flipside
i guess cause he can squishy melt
really?
reinhardt is so godo tho
hooks thru shield?
really? why jacq?
and edgelord robot
which is one of the reasons i am glad he is a happy robot and not
it's jjust that ppl who tend to play bastion tend to play a lot of bastion and then b very happy with how good they are at bastion
there's nothing wrong with playing bastion
kk
filthy bastion players getting what they deserve
so good
wait that's

and you're like
if you look at something
like

tinder squicks me out but that's just me
THIS IS WONDERFUL
will keep in mind
playing overwatch
cyberwarfare argument is gr9 tho
you got more than like, a 60% on it, you'd be pulled for further screening to see how useful you were
from what i've heard from my father, there was a basic math/logic test
i certainly hope not
at least
i don't think so
no way man
we'd be thrown into an office
if any of us got drafted
okay let's be honest tho
perform some magic
well even if they do i can just
good thing i noticed tho b/c i was gonna leave an assignment until tmrw but now i have time to get started on it today
so i should probably be okay
also that's in line with the email i sent him
pretend i was in poland until after the MP was submitted
hm i can just
but my timezone is listed as in us/central
i submitted an mp acc to the deadline for when i was in poland
technically i'm back but also
for my 220 hw assignment
kindratenko updated my timezone which changes my submission time
suddenly worrying
well i'm
twitchiness
rxn time and
writing simfiles?
what is this for?
i think it's specialized hardware i don't think they're compatible
hrrrm even then
female microusb to regular usb
get an adapter
you
unless
no, i do not believe the can be used with a pi 3
i don't think you need to cancel tho
you can probably cancel by emailing them
if not email him and ask he responds to emails
google pipboy 3d print
he's got plans availabel online?
Austin there's a dutch guy
b/c the processor is faster and there's more ram
or whatever the most recent is
pi 3
buy a regular old
just wanna
you might
hold on harris
pi zero back in stock
there's a cool boardgame called dead of winter

"At least the EU will run quicker and more efficiently now that they freed up 1 GB of space."
however it's also important to understand where media you like is being shitty and could be better
i'ts an excellent example of realpolitik
yes, got is good
slow down friend
but you yank the same shitty from-tolkien-era tropes
you CAN create worlds
like fantasy as a genre is a bit annoying bc
game of thrones is pissing me off rn b/c gay characters are not being allowed to be happy b/c they're gay
amazing
this guy is
WILLISDUMB
If it's good and near Union
wait maybe
not really?

oh but
ea
who are my top two at 3hrs WA
and 50% on soldier
I'm 60% on mei somehow
wow-we
which is :(
I don't think I'll play it much tho cause 220+work means I won't be able to git Gud
we need the knowledge
Neil pls
Jacqui that is literally the happiest I have have ever seen a dog in your care
grow it so it can bloom
you must cultivate your social dick
less good at studying shit we don't care about and better at socializing and establishing rapport with others
well tbh neil and i have a bit in common
yep that's just cause i'm a prude wrt drugs
a different neil
or at least
i'm a less capable Neil
like
friend collecting and all that
i do like meeting people
but yeah
today was not computer-free
so uh
i also spent 10 hrs on an MP today by accident
/are doing things you care about
and also when they're ppl you care about
networking is so much fun when you're doing it right
super chill and alse i met like 25 ppl
it was
w kris
i went to this indie games event
ok so
depends where it's at
@Hoolootoo id be down but
i don't even know
why x0D exists
caught the error, didn't have a catch for the other kind of newline
ie how do i input the character
how does GETC work with cli lc3sim?
my favorite is incompressible jizztrumpet
i'm not planning on buying anything
you seriously plan that far ahead for games?
jeez jacqui
why?
Nate
for steam sale
are games sticking at their min price rn?
idk it exists
but
cause the teampseak
idk why you'd need one
i made an xff5353 one
btw friendos if you're in need of a discord server for whatever erason
but fb iscreepy
messages won't load offa the server
groupme's so fricking bad
hopefully they will fix
tweeted at them and emailed that i'm dumb
no
no

and a buncha markersdraw
on a roller
whiteboard paper
what if we got like
that'd be amazing
..........................................................
draws
you could draw like circuit diagrams and shit
a projector screen
it'd be like
this would be really fun?
so it can draw vector images
that has xy stepper motors
build a whiteboard
hey guys let's
unique events cost a lot more to produce
also I'm just salty about it rn
when $300 cheaper is likely possible
$500 snot worth
but like 4 me personally
true
that's there
yeah
convenience outweighs quality
audiophile scum
else your point is ambiguous
qualify the word difference when making that statement
information should be accessible
recorded theater can be shared more easily
to me, not really
to you, sure
look Mary
frankly Broadway would do well to make shows more accessible
even seen it in person
well then why
or even $500 for 1x
not dropping $3k for 6x tix
L M A NO hamiltix are $500 premium seating only left no thank u
.04 better than usualy
wait it's only like
cause the exchange rate is diving
oh i can finally buy the alfred powerpack
it's friggin hilarious
like they threaten it all the time cause Uk politics are a bit of a shit fest anyway
oh lol pms in gb resign frequently
buy pounds now
ie
gbp is tanking tho cause current vote results
parliament still has to approve
so
It's 48/51 rn
it's v close tho
brexit better not fucking happen
fuckin
probably for the best I have 220 stuff to do
motherfuck my laptop won't connect to hotel internet

hmm
noon pdt?
oops sorry
on mobile telegram
WAIT NOT ON MONILE DISCORD
also tumbsup
if you swipe up
and also mute convos for an hour
to view a most recent message
you can hold prof pics on mobile discord
did you know that
like the loading animation takes 5evwr
and slowed it down
added 80% of telegram's features
if you took teamspeak
discord is kinda like
and it's confusing to add ppl to servers on mobile
but it also doesn't have video upload which is a pain
and the for gamers marketing pisses me off
it's slow which is annoying to me
discord is decent
my house is 100% empty which is weird
and I can't stop thinking in polish
Welp I'm back
I literally went fifteen minutes between the plane touching down and walking out the airport
global entry is the best 10/10 do recommend

please only hit on people with puns from now onward
......... AUSTIN
MOD CHARTS IN VR WOULD BE U N R E A L
HOLD ON
you'd have to deal with dance game player sweatiness tho
the novel thing would be to Lock it in the center of your fov bc you'd alway see the screen
leave them locked on part of the screen.... like a regular display
you could either lock them in the center of the fov or
for vr... you'd wanna make the arrows visible on a vr display
if you were visually tracking feet you'd run into issues with how current pros play vs how you'd have to make ppl play to deal with the constraints of visual recognition
timing windows are 22.5ms wide on the most accurate note rating for the DDR variant we play
on the topic of puns
it's fun but IMO groove coaster is best
apparently the cabs don't come w software
I will letchya know if a nearby groove coaster ever comes up tho
that's cool
wait can you make a thing
close enough to ship for p cheap

CODE WORKED ON 3rd try
20 lines of code
on the flipside it was like
but with a flowchart next to me my eyes wander to the flowchart and that keeps me on track
normally i'll get stuck so my mind will wander
flowcharting A+
that may have been the least painful LC3 coding session i've ever had
holy shit
ty for stack pointer tho
w/o loop constructs
okay i'll be lazy for now and just dump them into memory
i imagine that'll come up later
ie store all the registers on stack?
hrrm okay
i think i've gotta store my important data to memory and reaccess it after the subroutine
or
is there a magical LC3 implementation i can use eg making the subroutine a trap vector instead
how do i deal
this subroutine clears all my registers
i used all my registers and now i need to call a subroutine
i fucked up

ify ou count immediate suburbs (ie ones that touch chicago w/o farmland in between (eg jacob)) then that tnumber becmose 8 or 12m
the city proper has a population just under 3 m

Anna I can subjectively and decidedly say the only bad feature of your personality is your puns
when are you leaving?
Wednesday
Wednesday?
yes
uh
I usually do not
it depends on if I sleep on the plane or not
two or three days.
+7 relative to IL. 15:30.
Poland. one sightseeing stint to a northern town. the rest in Kraków and a nearby town.
24/7 w parents makes that hard
one thing I did not realize is that I very much enjoy at least an hour or two a day of personal time
what the shit is this, an early dark souls level?

i love this movie so much i can't wait
as computer students we're problem in the top 5% in google-as-a-skill
okay but to be fair
filling up your hard drive is reversible
tho tbh my favorite still continues to be cat /dev/urandom > file
rm -rf *
su root
easy
you learn far quicker the worse you fuck up
and trust me
that's how we learn
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES
tbh it's my answer to life universe everything
>Google "home directory"
"I'm not sure what the home directory is"
but google exists
...google "what is a home directory"
first dumb question of the year

hatoful bf?
I think
I asked you months ago
in other words tomorrow is her birthday
that is a good thing to miss IMO BUT to each their own
we have successfully secured a slightly later train
it's kinda hard shifting from "parents always drive" mode to "kids help the parents drive"
simply needed to peek in the station to check which track the train was on
cause this was rather preventable
looks like my error-checking module needs a tune-up
most likely
taking a train another day
and by adventure I mean
BUT THATS OKAY adventure it fun
but now we're on a bus that we didn't buy a ticket for and we're like to miss the next train
it's okay we didn't like get on the wrong train
we didn't know which one
there were three trains
made a mistake
we have uh
as long as it's not leaking my ip but even the
could t give a fuck
skype's been gone for ageeees
didn't even know it existed
Harris who the fuck do you think I am
old
who gives a shit not me
nah just discussions and i mean like
i wonder if i could be stubborn and just. not.
i have to install skype for ece220 and i am /appalled/
idk i thik i'd like best to travel with precisely one other person
TO BE FAIR i'm pretty slow moving esp. when we're going places
historically
but i've been worse
i'm bad at not arguing over petty things or making petty stabs
to be fair family vacations are often a source of tension more so than stress relief
those things compounded and an argument broke out with her questioning why she takes me on family vacations
she was also compelling me to go to the groom's house across the street and i didn't want to
we're all tired b/c wedding and we need to pack to leave for another city at 7am tmrw
just a bit of bickering with mother
i'm far more relaxed than i used to be, but that's not saying much
i think it's reconciliable though
vacation has officially hit the familiar shit hit the fan pt

not too bad yes
okay wow the vodka literally does not stop
don't forget the family-only party, the poprawiny, tomorrow
mass, ceremony, party, party, party
you're such a fucking nerd
14hrs
a wedding that goes from 16:00 > 06:00

that phrasing is misleading, if you work out regularly that counts as training
dead, probably
then again lc3 so i'm not missing much
today in ian has failed to prioritize: lots of time digging for a root pw when i could've been coding
svn is literally fuckni svn checkout and then svn commit
local/remote setup
git add, commit, push
git reqs like
but... better....
git is more complex
this is true
why does our school use svn when it could use git
hour thirty away by car
no physical activity
tbh i think it's cause of
it's like 17:30 and i'm tired
a bad idea
hm that sounds like
sleep, right?
what do you do when you're tired

generic popeful statements
or you might say
generic hopeful statements
BC IM ON TWITTER IN POLAND
I GET ADS TO FOLLOW THE POPE

i would dream about lol healthbars draining since i played bursty assassions
broforce is on sale
heyo so
cause it's a hilairous game
i have it in the apartment
she bought it a few months ago
jacqui has a copy
that's what polish cats are
and every animal there loved you
and then you went somewhere new
imagine if every animal you ever touched hated you
it's like
POLISH CATS ARE SO NICE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
get hype?
did you know that torrent files preallocate space and fill it with 0s
I get picky if I think a game is shit tho
If it's with friends, just about anything
female protagoniiiiiist
ooh dishonored 2
grumpy ass old man nerd
i'd say it's worth picking up in a 4pk
i've played it, it's an excellent time
oh maybe i have the expendabros
is it free or
believe my brother has it, therefore i do. tis an excellent time
me: "uhhhh my polish isn't very good,
sorry! bye!
"and you go to church with that?"
"you have such colorful hair!"
old polish lady
I get on the train
you don't understand this game is so good
click on probs?
mordor
we need to get you on skyrim
mary
yeah but unless they're paying modders they can't just port mod code
why would you remaster a 5yo game????
the game's 5yo?????
yeah but like
wrt what they're annoucing at e3
that's the rumor
THEY'RE REMASTERING SKYRIM
APPARENTLY
but also board games are expensive
tbh i'd rather table if possible
Austin imo username is better than gamertag
@Hoolootoo what are you up to this summer?
also timezones
i'm gonna hafta pass on tis one too, shitinternet
I don't think I have you on steam
nate possibly
jbb, austin afaik
boo
what's it like
on campus i mean
also what is halloween even
nonethless i think a casual cosplay for halloween would be v doable
set
i don't think you would! but i'll respect your decision if you're dead-et
and ragin parties
ppl who don't shower
just be ready for weird ppl
it's a good time with friends for sure
cause that's what anime cons are
weirdos
be wary of
you colud
hrrrrrrrm
which
i will be able to offer you advice and connections to ppl who cosplay very often
you can certainly do an all-out tracer cosplay if you wish
if you've never cosplayed before there's a lot to it
cheaper
it requires work but falls into the more-accessible category and also
like orange pants and a shirt w/tracer's harness
tho we could totally pull casual characters for halloween
i don't think i can juggle class and work and this
tbh i don't think i'm up for this now
and appropriate diffusers
i wouldn't worry about sound but tracer in traditional costume would req leds for sure
by any means
it's not cheap
200-500
the materials for this kind of cosplay are in the $2-500 range
austin you should be aware
my standards would require perfection
hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrm
when is comicon
kris is female
SO
kris
nah just the theme i use so i remember i'm on server and not elsewhere
what the actual
what the fuck
i

use Linux for everything else
use win10 for game
tbh
less tracky bullshit
and 7 is better on grounds of
7 is better but you'll probably have to nerf the autoupdaters
literally
he uses Linux 24/7
10 has better hardware optimization
that's hyper text coffee pot communication protocol or something to that effect
and then have proprietary unfixable parts
it looks like it'll break
yeah
it looked designed to give people who like  a e s t h e t i c  boners
it doesn't look well design
no
lol
design student
typos rife thru the project tho
made by five white dudes, lead appears to be a design student who started it as a university project
i mean yeah the void is pretty chilly
they hyphenated bluetooth
cool that they're using a peltier plate for it tho
this thing is designed for making a single cup of coffee at a time
yeah, stuff that's been through multiple design cycles tends to be
attach a buzzer and you've got an alarm clock
and you can have an automatic coffee make
or any sub fifty dollar dev board, potentially wifi-enabled
get any old coffee maker and an arduino
literally
apparently you can put the BEL code into filenames which makes you computer beep every time you access that file
removes execute permissions on the utility that enables you to control permissions
ikr I went to the computer sec board first too and it looks like your standard phpbb forum....
the tweet is the explanation
filth
yep
and how they respond to and build tech
namely internal stuff
watching the businesse process from the inside is strange
no
can i hear the difference as an unexperienced speaker
sometime i hate polish
włączyć   - turn on
wyłączyć - turn off
where'd you hear about this?
granted the langage is vague so it's up to each contruy
committing a crime and having to do an online class
it's like
it's not a camp and terming it as such is dumb and designed to evoke gay reconditioning camp stigma
yeah it does only apply to minors
mostly fluff and definitions of hate crime/ethnic groups
yeah I just read thru 10/12 pages
eu
but it actually does stuff? wow su
that document is in un format
I'm not a minor
that's ducked up tho

Mary
that is possible
I COULD BE BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION
I did get a drunk friendly FaceTime call in December
I suppose
he has replied to the middle
of three messages sent in the past couple of months
pubchats are cool for me
I'm a very open person
gradual distance from the friend group
I dislike losing friends
I like making friends
One of them is working with him over the summer
he wasn't there
one of the three
mention of his name, i.e. thinking about him, usually upsets me
some of them are still good friends with him but he doesn't reply to my texts
there was one guy I had a really savage falling out with
feeling a lot worse after hanging with them tho
met up with high school friends today
How's the battery life?
Jacob, nate's sager is nice and has beefy graphics
There's no way I did worse than Neil
I'm offended
Can we collect the final somehow?
That can't be right
How the fuck did I miss 1/4 of the questions
It is kinda unreasonable
Wait
but like it's not unreasonable
Idk how the fuck I got a 75 on the final
I'm salt I got an A- in 110
D only if you have a job lined up and are graduating
C- for sure
No, diffeq
110?
I have a Jaune cosplay
I'm down
MacBooks are superior hardware to most other laptops on market

and maybe get deeper into it
and then kill bosses
spend your first 10 hours learning the combat
it's more like
dark souls doesn't really have much in the way of a story
^
i think itheres' a telegram stickers subreddi
or like
there are good reddits
that host the links
there are a couple shitty sites
i've previously found them by googling
idk it seems like the kind of game you would like
good writing overall?
some monsters and a dungeon like thing
farmville but no time-delay, you just have your character go to bed
but in a funny way?
tend to be sexual tho
has hilarious puns and jokes
has gays
anna would love stardew valley

friendly reminder that the innovation banquet is tmrw
@jbb what email address
i'm lunching at noon
I'm going to chomps for breakfast and also to fix this bullshit charge
Which course number?
my campaigns in the past have failed because of an overemphasis on the rules
i would recommend a casual short-term campaign to get the ropes and emphasize the important part, ie roleplaying and storytelling
that is a good point
that's why i'm down so many credits
i got charged credits for a dinner bc of a terminal fuckup
gross
You start smaller, and emphasis is more holistic / role-playing than just getting and using powers.
I just like that you don't start off with like five different abilities with various descriptions, modifiers, effects, etc.
Super-streamlined and much less overwhelming, though the rulebook is still written like garbage in terms of ease of use and structure. Plus, no need for combat grid.
5e is much much better
If we're gonna dnd, we're gonna 5e
possible door lockage
uh

11pm

Q: What's the difference between USA and USB?
A: One connects to all your devices & accesses your data, and the other is a hardware standard
studying more important
actually
if you're on a pc join
will cost you money
next to chomps
you're not gonna survive 212
which means probabl ddr
i have no plans after my midterm
phys midterm
well, that's average, i can probably pound out a word in less time
so a keyboard doesn't need to poll faster than 7hz at my speed
sorry by 60 is 6.67
i avg about 400 chars per min typing, therefore 400/6 = 66.7
when was the last time a major world power annexed a country
lol FUCK no
and then congress was like
obama's statements in the days following were like "this is bullshit, what the fuck, you need to stop"
well
beyond like, US sanctions on a few russian oligarchs
and walked away without any repercussions
i'm still kinda mad putin literally annexed part of a country in twenty fucking fifteen
obama kinda had his hands tied coming out of iraq
but putin might be a bag of dicks and walk out
i don't think it's gonna like dissolve
re: un
why? has something happened recently?
caused the UN anyway
the whole point was the intent
i find comical
league of nations
motherDuck bae
case-specific
/GET JUSTICE LEAGUE
i read that as
"The policy further says: "If you are convicted of a crime or subject to a disposition of a criminal proceeding, you are subject to discipline. But even if your conduct does not result in a criminal conviction, if the league finds that you have engaged in conduct [prohibited by the policy], you will be subject to discipline.""
Domestic abuse among professional athletes is not a new problem, but it became a nationally recognized issue when Baltimore Ravens football player Ray Rice assaulted his then-fiancee, now wife, last year and was only suspended from two NFL games.[1] The incident took place in elevator in a hotel, in which Rice knocks out his wife- the video was released by TMZ. Prior to the incident, the NFL’s conduct policy stated that players would be disciplined for domestic abuse offense, but gave no specifics, so the league was left scrambling to come up with an appropriate punishment for Rice.
it should not be tolerated.
the football league should suspend players that beat up their wives.
tolerates
.
not advocates
.
not to mention that it often circumvents the legal process
and there have not been rules implemented that suspend players for reasonable amounts of time
domestic abuse is a repeated problem
in football specifically
generalizing
idk about the rest of the entertainment industry
with tolerated domestic abuse
that's fair
but as a business
not recreational
simple as that.
i think sports are dumb.
but does not have extant substantial monetary and political influence that affects students who give no fucks about them
games culture is garbage
football culture is garbage and its influences on the college system in the united states is atrocious
I feed
tmux dislikes opening gui applications
there's the base game for $40 and +5x skins for $60

yep
uh, 6x skins actually
shit for other games
5x skins
tmrw is the last day to buy overwatch if you want preorder bonuses
<3 ece
Nate, aren't you shooting for one?
So MEng's don't offer any substantial like. Salary bonuses?
Apparently there's a substantial difference between masters in science and masters in engineering
please speak up if you object, or forever hold your peace.
as such, assuming coolness across the board, i have asked austin to extend and invitation to her to this chat.
btw: yanting, our friendly neighborhood physics major who isn't austin, is very cool and appears to be interested in befriending this group

Terrible speaker
Ohhhh nnnoooo
Some states have lower min wage cause lower cost of living
Which makes sense
Mary, there's a state and federal min wage
The fact a shithead of a state like SC can pass anti-trans laws that take a step backward
What bugs me is the power states have relative to the central govt
Local functions need to continue
@mary that's not entirely true
In my opinion.
The underlying motivation of all legislative bodies within a country should be international cooperation
We are an international society now
And a lack of cooperation between state and federal law enforcement
As evidenced by what comes out of legislation houses in states
I mean to say that i believe often people representing states do not think what is best for the overall country
Idk for a fact tho
The underlying attitude isn't necessarily cooperation
Federal structure is getting dated
Supreme Court decision in 1967 officially made laws frobidding it unconstitutional
Illinois made it legal before 1887
Interracial marriage has only been fully legal in the US since 1967????

(b) A 4 minutes song is stored on a CD-ROM. It is digitized using 16 bits per sample and 20.60 MBytes (for this problem, use 1MB=220B). How many samples per second were used (In other words, what was the sampling rate used)?
do this ece 110 problem
jacob
what do you want
who is outside my door
wait that's it
i have that
no
wait
gotta do tot # samples / time
bad math
oop
the conversion factor for MB to B
that is
which is dumb??? bc???? i'm doing 20.60 x 2^20?
Computer notations must be used here, e.g. 1k is not 103 but 210 instead. See a past tutorial on computer notations.
it's throwing me a help msg
(20.60*2^20)/(4*60*16)
so i must be misunderstanding something
i think my math is right
what the fuck is this problem

i think it wants you to

i'm trying to tell if this final cs 101 hw is trying to make you implement a sorting algorithm
when stored in variables
i didn't know that python treated dicts differently from ints
so updating that var doesn't change what's in the memory location
the var is immutable
a vvar to an int
setting like
wheares
they're just two vars ponting to the same memory location?
set one python dictionary to another

i'm so salty about loosing my dance game shoes and laptopthat i wake up
at thihs point
i see keyswitches in the incinerator which backs this up
my backpack is out of sight so i presume it's been toasted
how does that even happen
i look up at the tall asian dude tossing shit into the incnerator and i'm like 1. what the fuck 2. how the fuck was there a nuclear accident in a fucking high school
i'm salty
one shoe is missing
and i grab it
anyway i see my dance game bag being pushed down the incinerator line
like the full-stoppy-ness
that is an option i'm fond i'm spaced tho
it's getting tossed into an incinerator
there's a large room full of shit
i head up there
what the fuck
i'm like
she's like "isn't everything on fourth flloor getting burned?"
i ask abou the classroom
there are ppl my age there and for somereason kim gasciciel
i swing near the classroom by climbing up some stairs and fittings between a wall and a support post
lots of balconies and railways
except it's got a slightly darker aesthetic about it
more like a large multilevel mall or a super nicely laid out office building
the school is larger than i remember
i am wearing roller blades
i need to get from the ground floor of my high school to the second floor homeroom class (religion) to get my backpack and dance game bag
i abscond the supermarket and go back to my high school
i look at his wif ewho has a vacant expression
by this guy
for some reason i'm uncomfortably pinned up against one of those machines that makes custom dog tags
he tries to explain working hard and stuyding for calculus courses is important by talking about his kid who goes to princeton
i try to explain consent
i literally vomit some mwater
he hugs me
he's preachy about religion
he is wearing a white baseball cap and sunglasses. very dad ilike. taller than me
there's a white dude and his wif
i pay for my bread and meat and stuff it intomy backpack
i ask them about it and they equivocatethe entire prcoss of their gettign checked out tiakes annoyingly long
the person in front of me responds to the cashier's rppmopt of how would you like to pay with "a firetruck and 17 cents"
so i'm at a supermarket buing two slices of bread and two slices of meat
i had another weird dream

blackwatch was just overwatch's covert ops division
overwatch formed to counter the robots
the good ppl
but so are the overwatch heroes
basically
the omnic crisis
the point is that there was a massive war when robots decided to rebel for rights
i don't think so
sketchier stuff
blackwatch did like
basically
the evil alignment characters are mostly from blackwatch
blackwatch did the sketchier shit
overwatch was the main task force for dealing with the omnic crisis/robot revolt
overwatch and blackwatch
there are two factions
When designing the game, Blizzard wanted the world presented to be as fantastical as possible while still being relatable to modern-day Earth.[17] The setting of the game is intended to be a mix of the "dark and gritty," while also being "a world of color and sound and light." It is intended that it be a setting that players will want to keep coming back to and be invested in.[18] Events such as the Omnic Crisis were made up as the lore was developed rather than being pre-planned.[16] It was decided to have the game's setting post-both the Omnic Crisis and the golden age that followed, in order to leave it open ended, and allow creation of new heroes that weren't part of Overwatch, but were inspired by it.
no deathmatch gamemode will be planned, cause team-based
new heroes will be added over time for free
absolutely not
Overwatch is set in a futuristic Earth, sixty years into the future. Thirty years ago, robots took over the world, leading to the formation of an international taskforce called Overwatch, which ended the war in mankind's favor. Overwatch was disbanded thirty years after its formation, and in the five years since, the world has become a darker place. However, a new threat is looming, and heroes will have to band together to defeat it.[2] Multiple factions exist in the world, operating in various shades of gray.

the big plot event is the "omnic crisis"

Beta Test Weekend strike team: it's time to re-deploy!

From Friday, April 15 through Saturday, April 16, we'll be hosting our second invitation-only Beta Test Weekend. For a limited time (36 hours to be exact), we'll be opening up the Overwatch beta test to a much larger number of players in the Americas, Europe, and Asia gameplay regions for another round of stress testing.

The objective: help us get our server hardware and technology ready for release!

all it does it edit bytes
vim is literally a text editor
^ concur
how'd you get baited into tha?
learn vim together
we could all do it this wkend
tbh, i'm gonna sublime until i feel like learning vim
definition: fun way to learn vim. google it.
the spread of characters is also fantastic
all the characters have an immediate story visible in just their design
they are fantastic designs
^
zarya is buff as fuck
and mei
objection, roadhog
s
-fitting tight?
all these characters need form
but it's dumb that most of the female characters would wear that kinda clothing
eg
TO BE FAIR that kinda butt's not entirely unrealistic
don't have ppl who are like "hey that butt's kinda dumb"
that ppl who model make characters like that
i assert that it's a passive status quo
i agree that it's not active decisions to make female character models have more defined butts
yo the lebanese bait is zarya
and modeling/designing more traditionally
more that the top-tier modelers that work for blizzard generally going to be dudes
eh, that's not really accurate
the game's gonna cater to guys
granted, this is blizzard, so surprise surprise
since clothing doesn't work that way
hoewever it's kinda stupid how all the female characters have ridiculoulsly sharp buttcracks
which means it's hard to change
it's the polygons
verdict
basically she looked to see if the shading was due to the model's texture (ie, an easy edit) or the actual polygons
She decomposed the model and looked at the textures.
on what grounds did they take down gilvasunner?

yes @ bae
i don't frequently remeber dreams but when i do it's typically when i wake up, and go back to sleep for exactly 1.5 hourso
at least, it was early stages cause ppl were looting a store across the street
it wasn't actually that much of zombie apocalypse?
and then i wake up
it's a motherfucking zombie apocalypse and you were at the gym
at some point i'm like, guske, you're a moron
so i activate another tooth and the dog is thankful
the system looks like a bunch of big teeth and its units are memory per dog year
but its memory can be expanded?
somehow it has a limited amount of memory?
it recoils
try petting it
i'm like "sorry"
i'm like "shit, not a zombie dog"
the dog is suddenly on the table near the sink, in a neck brace, looking very hurt and sad
running my hand under hot water
run to my backpack to get a disinfecting alcohol wipe that i carry arround
i'm like "fuck it got me" cause i have a small scrape on my left hand (i actually have a small scrape on my left hand rn)
"gg, well played"
hear snapping noise
prosa aims a kick at its neck
i throw it away from me
i manage to juke its bites bc i've done that before, by grabbing the jaw correctly
it goes for my hand
SHIT, ZOMBIE DOG
i'm like
one of the dogs, white with purple spots, jumps up
he grabs my hand and somehow the scrawny individuals that are prosa and me pull him up onto the roof
tell him to jump and grab my hand
carrying his gym bag and tailed by zombies and dogso
GUSKE, RUN
start shouting
that's him in the distance
oh shit
i'm like
i'm like didn't he go to the gym
prosa's like, i wonder where guske is
anyway he finishes that and we go chill on the roof bc the other two ppl who came in with me are having AN INTIMATE TIME on the bed in the room where we all came it
which prosa is filling up with water and water balloons, presumably as a place to go to hide from zombies bc they can't see/smell/etc you underwater?
and another roof
it's attached to our room via like, window
there's also a bathroom-like thing, where caleb arbers and a girl who looks like a girl from my high school but isn't are hanging out
the balcony is pretty big, it's more like a roof
okay so
the room has a balcony
one of them has slightly magical powers?
there are two other people with me
barricade myself in a room
run upstairs
"NOPE"
and i'm like
he's like "oh okay" and then sits there on his laptop and gets bit
so i run over to david null and i'm like "yo, that girl, she's a zombie, watch out"
at some pt it's confirmed that there are now zombies?
basically we were all in a buil, classrooms on the ground floor
i rarely remember dreams which makes it more fun
*i'm glad i slept that extra 1.5 hours, i had a zobie apocalypse dream
I had a K kept zombie apocalypse dream

Yeah, hyper light drifter
disgustingly buggy
@paul is it a pedal?
not cheap enough to be effective tho, like $30
and use the pedal for speed control
therefore you just plug the dremel in
foot pedals that vary power
there are
of all forums
lmao
could you hack it
i wonder
variable dremel is really necessary
small ones
in innovation rn
two free avocado jimmy johns sammiches
there are
i prefer variable
ideally
5
but that's only 2 speed
no speed control
35000 rpm
yeah
i don't think it has variable spee
it might be garbage?
hold up
tn is hyper light drifter
later
i'm trying it
saw that
yeah
buying one
$30 dremel
I'll give it a shot
And then use that open source vr driver
I could emulate

Lunching, noon.
Or refine your point and express it more clearly.
Wait for a good opportunity, because it'll be more effective in getting your point across.
Don't respond in a particular manner just because you're salty and a shitty opportunity arises.
I am not currently shirposting, I'm responding to Paul's shitpost and organizing the possible groupbuy of a game.
Basilios, the only reason you're saying that is because you're mirroring my exact words, and you were offended by them.

bc plugins
it's part of the system
wordpress installs get infected
and reset any files that were changed to previous commit
you can just git status it on the server that you're running
that way, when it gets infected
dump it in a github repo
btw, if yall ever have to wordpress site
there's a one-liner script
also really nice git shit
displays files, including hidden, with permissions, sizes, groups, and more info idk
l = ls -lah

Wait, wasn't
UNDERTALE MUSIC SRT

she's from the uk, she's the girl in all the undertale videos
jacqui, i believe there is a queen of mod charts
okay

Yo ill probably be up
Are any of y'all getting in tn?
Is anybody gonna be on campus sat?
But you can homebrew the shit outta the things
You need a game cart with exploitable code on it and those aren't cheap
They're super hackable
I'm sorry but when I'm salty the restraints are off
sounds good to me
i'm gonna ptero him a new asshole i s2g
reset the router password as soon as i texted him about it
my fuck of a father i s2g
alrgihtly then
your dad is capable of setting up a router
and this
this
get
do it rn
renting fees are a bullshit $10/mo
yeah no
sure enough it's the piece of shit iot camera system my dad bought
i was wondering what the fuck was running on my home network, publically facing
and a decent router
convinced your father to buy the midrange arris surfboard modem, sb4141 or rsomething
disgusting
wps is super fucking exploitable
please tell me you don't actually have wps enabled
that's disgusting
when i do my own router i'm fucking rolling opnewrt or ddrwt
i'm officially hella salty
it uses some linksys bullshit
our router password is consistently not what i think it is
most hacks happen thru passive scripts trolling anyway
and routers are super exploitable
because he uses shitty passwords
no
i'm on a fucking thrain to champaign
he asked me for the car key
we literally could be
no
"Where's the key for the car"
"dad i need to know we might be getting hacked"
"dad did you change your password"
"dad"
not all of us can achieve >1khrs in a game
be kind

linux webbrowsers
not-bloaty not shitty

"if they look like they're thirty, they're 12. if they look like they're 12, they're thirty."
as my father told my brother before he left for japan yesterday

`@austin yeah it's pretty straightforward
apparently it can also do tab autocompletion over ssh? so like iif you need to scp files
the only thing i've noticed so far that's really nice is better highlighting and it fixes incorrect case for tab autocompletion
apparently
it's like bash but better
all unix
is your default browser set correctly?
can't say, when in doubt reinstall. also, grow up, use a *nix os
don't think so. reading up now
what device/client variant are you using?
this distributes the work across multiple machines
compiling C on a local machine
across multiple machines
compiles c and c variants
is so cool
this
Details:
Who is interested in commuting up to chicago to participate in the google games?
A+ gif usage
has updates
however zsh is nicer, better color highlighting
bash is standard, ships on all systems
it's maintained regularly
where a shell is the thing you open when you opne terminal
an open-source, community-maintained shell alternative
has anybody ever tried oh my zsh

You might call it

I'll respect it
But
I think poll chat is stupid
Honestly
Austin, where do you live?
sand box-y
sorta sandboxie
indie game, looks quite pretty
has anybody heard of subnautica?
*shops
I would recommend either the Lego exhibit at msi or checking out the area around Kris's apartment, which features food and a retro game shop/sex shop/assortment of other things.
I'll figure it all out by tonight.
(All others are welcome, those four simply expressed prior interest)
@bae, @nate, @anna, @mary: Chicago trip on Thursday?

Arcade, DDR, factorio, sleep.
Whatchya doing rn
Hey Jacqui

Will check it out
I probably could've picked a better Xpath selector, but idk how my Python library handled bad HTML
Nonetheless I now have a script
Don't need the entire webpage, but that would probably work
Ditto. You typically just rip a waveform, .wav
more fun this way
but
tbh could've done it manually in half the time
also i wanted a soundtrack without manually downloading all 24 songs
learning python and web scraping better
then running a local webserver and hosting it
ended up locally downloaded the website and deleting the shit out of everything but what i needed
which was fucking up my selection of the elemetn
so it was missing a tbody tag
the html was shittily written
figured out my code

Yo that sounds good to me
Well take a chill dinner and then swim
swimming!
Gonna eat dinner promptly at 4:45
@jacqui is t that referenced in ready player one
The while point of polls is that they're accessible to the entire group bc you can see them regardless of how many messages have been since posted
Yes! Lets go to CRCE!
I'm bailing on mun. Who wants to go swimming?
Watching polisci majors use computers when I need them to print something for me is one of the most infuriating things
What are hours on pool?
But
I would like to buy mun
I wanna swim really badly actually

It's like a scavenger hunt but digital and gps enabled
What the fuck are you talking about @bae
Let's go later
who wants to go on an adenture
at one of these locations
there is a geocache
i believe
But that doesn't make it okay, they're fielding bad internettiquette
Slightly understandable when view in context of the fact it's used chiefly by high schoolers and middle schoolers
Which is not acceptable
No field for a source link
Literally zero concept or encouragement of attribution
The literal bottom scrapers of the Internet
It will unabashedly rehash Reddit, tumblr, 4chan, or straight up original content, recompress it with shitty jpeg compression, and attach a footer banner with some bullshit like "remixed by X for funnyjunk :)"
Is the most regurgitated anything
Funnyjunk
Okay but
Perhaps I'm being unfair.
I really dislike funnyjunk and 9gag. I don't have too much of a valid reason besides the fact that they're dumb, they pull money for your time, and that they started a lot of stupid feuds with other websites.
That website is trash.
I will come chop your forefinger off.
I swear to fuck.
The next time I click on a funnyjunk link.

namecheap
recommend
shitty website
v poor support
crap advertising campaigns up until very recently
godaddy is shit
they follow conventions
support is nice
it's nice
but yiou can get it from wherever so long as it's no godaddy
which is more expensive
r
23 at my preferred registrat
also bc i wanted a blog
yeah i made my site for colleges to look at
it's about $23/yr
tho you can buy ten years ahead which is insane?
where $10 is cheapest
.cz runs p expensive
mary, jablowi.cz isn't cheap
was chiefly for college admissions
blog
which means that some shitty service has dibs
but two letter domain names usually get sqjquatted
because then i could have kl@tz.co
stop that you
for p cheap
you can buy boxes of crap cards if you don't give a shit
but it's pretyt and has animations and costs a lot less
we could all do hearthstone
or
OR
google redirs
yfucking
that can't be real
that's hilarious
legit cheating?

that's my only req
i need 3 SBS
eugh
did you talk to a dean? did they shoot you down?
i think bc it's nonrestricted you can just drop thru web form?

i'm a bit disappointed
form a lowkey pranking society
we should do real pranks
i love pranks
yeah they seem pretty tame when compared to what MIT's do
It's a tradition
They prank campus
And when they get in
Like +10 kids a year or something
It's like an honor society for engineering students
It's a knights of st Patrick joke
No
They don't have enough staff
playing dota
for unofficial?
ah
No, because I am just to me'shuga to be cool.
tbh, i'd recommend getting it from china

@jacq
Shitpost red welcome
Btw hw party in garage
I though you meant necrophilia briefly
i have experience w it too
FATE as a system also works
i've heard 5e doesn't suck?
3.5 or pathfinder
also i abuse system mechanics bc of who i am
that was a problem that i had running 4e
roleplay is where the fun is at
the system should not get in the way of roleplay
so the thing about dnd from my experience
then splinter
have new players watch or maybe tag team
just a short campaign, a one-nighter of 4hrs or so
i would recommend a first session dm'd by basilios and with experienced players
we have too many interested ppl probably

The correct classification today is actually developing vs. developed.
*technically incorrect classification. First world refers to US and its allies in  cold War. Second world refers to ussr and its allies. Third world is everyone else. Switzerland is therefore technically third world, I believe.

I'm walking to math and I see three very similar girls. I'm like "wow white girls really do look alike". "Wait." "They're identical." "They are literally the same person." "They have the same jackets." "THEY WALK THE SAME WAY." "Oh wait their backpacks are different colors." "Gotta be triplets."

sw galaxyies was fucking fantastic
an this is why
So it was just crazy
And then it appears on the game map
And put down some buildings you bought the parts for
Walk out to a random part of the planet
Like just
And built a village
Or you could go to a planet
Or just bounty hunt
Just because the players were cool and did that sort of thing
With a Jedi Master and everything
And become a padawan
You could just join one of the random jedi / sith orders that founded themselves as player communities
Or
And do PvP based on that
And complete missions to attain ranks
And you could enlist in Rebellion or Empire
With pilot and gunners
And those starships could be multiperson
Cuz of course, it had a fully built-in space travel / combat system
You could buy / build starships
Like
So, in short: 1. oodles of content and customizability, 2. however, not much structure or guidance, 3. but, awesome community full of dedicated RPers and guides.

i was up at 4am when the pi zero was annouced
i'm so mad at myself
jesus
christ it's delightful that the hardware is this cheap
debian variant looks lke
what's the processor
thing is, need a pi zero
ezr than drivers

Moratorium
moratorium
Here's the thing. We can either continue expanding this chat, and most ppl will mute it and form specific subgroups, or we can put a moratorium on adding people.

important question
i'll head over, bae
so either growth or fandom saturation
k
the most recent pulled 22x
the first mlp fanreport pulled about 10k
i'm geuessing some open-ended major
wow
ppl have variable definitions
"fandom" is a bit hard to do tho
22k responses in the 2014 incarnation
80% male to 20% female, rounding and ignoring smaller gorup
mlp is no exception
big fandoms tend to pull statisticians within the fandom
so
mlp for some reason just happened to pull/create a lot of really good musicioans?
there are musical ppl in juist about every fandom
mlp's fanbase is pretyt huge
actually
are you shitting on bronies and weebs
jbb
